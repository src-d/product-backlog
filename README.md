# Product Backlog

This repository hosts the [Product backlog](https://github.com/src-d/product-tbacklog/issues/).

The Product Backlog is fully managed by the Product team,
and fed by the proposals accepted on the [feature idea](https://github.com/src-d/product-idea) repository.

## Contribute

We have made our backlog public for transparency's sake, but we do not expect any contributions from the community to be done on this repository. If you think this is wrong and would like to participate, you can get in touch with us via email to devrel@sourced.tech.

New issues can only be created by members of the Product organization, including VP of Product and Product Owner.

That said, members of the Engineering organization are welcome and expected to give input, comment, and update on the issues they're involved with.

## Methodology

- [General Workflow](https://github.com/src-d/guide/blob/master/engineering/workflow.md)

## Label Categories

The labels are used in different ways, we have 3 main categories:

- __Team__ used to filter by team, this tag is mandatory.
- __Priority__: these labels are used by the Product Team to prioritize the issues.
- __State__: a granular way to classify the status of an issue. Used on issues that are assigned to an ongoing sprint.
